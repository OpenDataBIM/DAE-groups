# Create Geometric Groups by Any Property
Create geometric groups by any property in the model
 
With a small piece of code, we can group all the elements of a project by any property of any element. Geometries created by this property will be located in the project folder. The script can be applied to many projects that lie in the folder at once.

# OpenDataBIM

https://opendatabim.io/

OpenDataBIM is a format for transferring information to another party without the need for external guarantors or trusted ‘third parties’, enabling data to be exchanged within 3D-7D systems and between construction parties directly, bypassing any third-party companies controlling data storage and transfer. OpenDataBIM allows you to automate work with project data. In order to get automatic data from thousands of projects automatically, you need to build the pipeline once on the open tools.
